// Package models contain reusable models that can be used for JSON encoding/decoding
// and other general purposes. These models have fields written in English, although database columns
// or JSON fields are in Bahasa.
// This package also acts like a documentation to map English fields to Indonesian fields. They are written
// like this so we can isolate the part of the codes that are written in Bahasa Indonesia (constrained by other
// parties outside PotatoBeans engineers) from the rest of codes written in English.
